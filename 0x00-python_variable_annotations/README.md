# Python - Variable Annotations

## Tasks

### Task 0
Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes a float `a` and a float `b` as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 1
Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes a string `str1` and a string `str2` as arguments and returns a concatenated string.

### Task 2
Write a type-annotated function `floor` which takes a float `n` as argument and returns the floor of the float.

### Task 3
Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float `n` as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

### Task 4
Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:
- `a`, an integer with a value of 1
- `pi`, a float with a value of 3.14
- `i_understand_annotations`, a boolean with a value of True
- `school`, a string with a value of “Holberton”

### Task 5
Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` which takes a list `input_list` of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 6
Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` which takes a list `mxd_lst` of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 7
Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string `k` and an int OR float `v` as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string `k`. The second element is the square of the int/float `v` and should be annotated as a float.

### Task 8
Write a type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that takes a float `multiplier` as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by `multiplier`.
