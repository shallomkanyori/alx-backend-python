# Python - Async

## Tasks

### Task 0
Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (`max_delay`, with a default value of 10) named `wait_random` that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

Use the `random` module.

### Task 1
Import `wait_random` from the previous python file that you’ve written and write an async routine called `wait_n` that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): `n` and `max_delay`. You will spawn `wait_random` `n` times with the specified `max_delay`.

`wait_n` should return the list of all the delays (float values). The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using `sort()` because of concurrency.
